Kimberly Perrotis,"Old Navy has very consistent sizing, unlike most brands at this price level, but shopping at its stores is miserable.  They don‚Äôt use air conditioning, the stores are crowded and messy, there are huge lines for dressing rooms and having different cashiering stations (or even just wandering employees with handheld scanners) for different payment methods and functions (cash, credit card, Old Navy credit cards only, returns).  Around 2018, my local store removed all cashiering stations, and customers had to find employees, who were busy with other tasks, apparently, who looked confused when asked to do a sale or return.  Gap and Banana Republic seem overpriced and have limited selections.  For example, in 2019, none of the three brands carried a women‚Äôs T-shirt in navy blue; it was, apparently, not an on-trend color.  These shops sell inexpensive basics, they should always have a good range of basic colors, not just the colors-of-the-moment.",2020-12-29T20:24:06Z,0

Another factor is that when companies around you are casual as well what makes you stand out? honestly, the styles between GAP, Hollister, A&F, Jack & Jones, and half a dozen others are so similar that most buyers will probably just go to one of those stores or whoever is cheaper, it's not as if GAP was known for quality anyway.",2020-07-04T00:18:37Z,0

Everything else is poorly made in third world companies with all shirts $20+. Next, their clothes are catered to families. NEWSFLASH‚Äîpeople in America are having LESS children. Thirdly, they have failed to adapt to the ever-changing fashion trends. Make it easier for consumers to find what they need and make it cheaper.

Jeremiah Mckenna,"Gap should have updated their style about 18 years ago, but wanted to stay conservative with what had worked for them in the past.  Well, we all know that you can't sped yesterdays money.  Their styling is bland anymore, and ""What was old is new again,"" won't work in this case.


Banana Republic changed their style to skinny jeans for both sides of the store, and held on to that fashion trend fail for far too long, and now it is hard to find anything on the men's side that separates it from the female side of the store.  Plus, their prices are way, way too high for the lower quality of materials and craftsmanship.  But that is what happens when you change your suppliers from higher quality manufacturers in places like Vietnam, to lower quality places like Mainland China.


Old Navy is ok, but also low quality for prices higher than Walmart.

heynorty013,Intermix is a super high end store that sell brands like Jimmy Choo and Alexander McQueen. It is not a store that sells it own branded clothes like the Gap or Old Navy. I am from NYC and I would see the Intermix shopping bag all the time on shoulders of young women all during the 2000s.,2021-03-18T21:08:41Z,0

and everyone else can be manipulated and conditioned through media what to wear through people like celebrities , who then get told to wear it to
keep them or make them famous. So It's a brainwashing chain of they tell me what to wear , i tell all you what's popular to be seen wearing , you wear it.
people need to get back to individuality regardless of what everyone else does , trends are cancer and modern America and society been sheep
long enough. Sell one of a kind extremely limited no logo exclusives and change it every month or just make a place where ppl come design and pick up

Khanh Ho,"I've seen GAP throughout the eras, as I still remember getting my Levi's there...and their old slogan 'Fall Into The Gap.'  The last time I found real excitement in buying from them was back in 1995, right before starting grad school.  I went shopping for some new clothes with my ex-girlfriend who was a high school teacher but, funny enough, is now a CEO of a major clothing company.  I still bought off and on with The Gap but it was mostly for basics...and generally because they would often have incredible sales.  But there were no statement pieces and certainly not much joy.  I'm now at a point where I just walk past.  I mostly buy my clothes from Barney's.  It feels like I get more value...even if I am paying more.",2019-10-15T17:18:59Z,1

comment,"all these stores are pretty junky and just promote the buy buy buy more more more mentality around clothes. They overwhelm buyers' senses to the point that when you walk in you want everything and nothing. Everything because it all looks kind of appealing in a very superficial way, and nothing because subconsciously you know you don't really need any of it. Some buyers will react by buying way more than they need and then feeling yucky about it, others will simply not be able to bear it and walk out as quickly as they walked in after a very brief glance around. These types of stores and the whole single-season pile-of-junk lots-of-shopping-time mentality they promote is the reason many people now shop online. Because you can zero in much more on what you actually need. People do NOT need a lot, they just need a few quality items that actually last. A lot of the clothes from these types of stores is ok until you wash it, and then it really changes somehow and is just never the same again. Europeans have a different mentality, at least used to, not so sure how it is now - they wear one outfit all week, changing maybe just the shirt and underwear, but it is quality stuff. The American economy is totally messed up. It's all about more more more, grow grow grow. Manipulate everyone into buying more junk, and then spending money on ways to get rid of it (what an irony!). It's not realistic. How can you have constant indefinite growth if the population isn't significantly increasing. It should be that a company just needs to maintain a steady revenue, fullfilling a particular and truly undeniable need. Stores like Gap confuse the human subconscious, because they are about want, not need. And people rarely truly know what they want and how much. Miserable miserable situation. Retail in general is a middle man, and so should be a very thin, minimal part of our economy.",2019-10-13T01:55:35Z,0

When fashion changed around 2000, they had already over extended themselves.  It‚Äôs always surprising to me that these companies don‚Äôt see their own failures.  As for Banana Republic, their niche was sort of an ecclectic and unique, limited range of clothes.  Then they started over doing it with the cargo pants.  I was a huge fan of theirs, but in the past 5 years they have reverted to the same marketing as The Gap.  Bland, over priced chino‚Äôs, sweaters and hoodies.  They‚Äôve lost that uniqueness.",2019-10-10T17:18:25Z,0

Already see a lot of chemical stabilizers in the prepared wrapped sandwiches. The same story when the new owner announces, ""Everything shall remain the same."" The first thing that happens is either fires or forces out those with deep knowledge of what works in the industry. Yeah, right, nothing changes.

iambackwithabang,"""they arent trying to explore the Indian market. ""
i have been using Levis since i was a lil kid. and im 32 now.but i started using Gap only when my brother went to the US in 2010 and have been using it till now.and my baby is clothed in Baby Gap,Old Navy and i use Banana Republic as well. but frankly all of them were brought by my brother in truck loads for me and later on for my kid from the US.
instead,growing up, Levis was always available in India and still continues to have stores even in small towns in India.
you can hardly find GAP or Baby Gap or Old Navy or Banana Republic stores even in big malls/clothing department stores in India. maybe in a few high end stores may have it.but thats far and few.
but unlike Gap-- Levis,Wrangler,Nike,Adidas & even UCB have a strong presence in metro cities, cities and small town shops(which keep a few pieces just in case a customer needs it) in India.
pretending to be a premier brand when ur cloth quality is almost the same(i mean gap and old navy and some banana republic pieces have the same fabrics and designs) and not promoting agressively in an emerging market like India is one of GAP Incs biggest mistakes.
btw : I have bought several Baby Gap pieces on Amazon India. but havent ever seen a single GAP store in a tier 2 or tier 3 city near me.",2019-04-02T01:59:59Z,1

BearMugs,GAP just lost what they had in the 80's. They need to keep up otherwise they will lose out. They have lost already. I think Old Navy was a big help but not necessarily a good thing because GAP inc was supplying 3 demographics. I believe that was one of their other flaws. Mostly not keeping up with fashion trends and sticking to what got them so big but also Banana Republic and Old Navy were holding them down. Old Navy was carrying 2 companies on it's back. But it's sort of a cycle of buying a small company that does well for a bit before the fashion changes. That's what happened  to GAP  and in a few years Athleta and Hill City.,2019-03-31T10:27:04Z,0

Kirsten MacLellan,"I worked at a GAP store for 8 years... You didn't mention how they sacrificed quality to cut costs. So many time customers complained sweaters weren't 100% wool or cotton, when they cut quality they lost loyal customers who went looking for it somewhere else. Also they literally stock THE EXACT SAME merchandise every year... 8 years of opening shipment, 80 of the new stuff co would be the exact same as the same season the year before... I would literally wear the shirt/blouse I bought 3years before that they would freakin match...",2019-03-24T14:00:18Z,184
comment,"Exactly! It's so annoying when not a single sweater is really wool. Nowadays you can literally go online and search for 'wool sweater', or in any catalog online same thing. If no results, i move to the next one. Plug in 'cashmere sweater' and see which online store has the best price and style for one. Now when you can't find quality pure cotton items at a place like Gap, then you know the place isn't worth the space it occupies. More junk cheaper made - that's the whole motto of the US economy",2019-10-13T02:46:04Z,8

Also, I definitely noticed that quality and prices are different in UK, US and CA. London had the best GAP stores and I miss living/shopping there. Fast fashion is dying, Gen Z kids are a lot more aware, responsible, so going back their roots would be the best solution.

I loved Banana Republic in the 90s, but their clothes became cut for fat 30-50 year olds from the early 2000s on...they went through a similar style decline that Nordstrom went through - their clothes would only fit chubby guys, trying to hide their fat areas. Gap and BR need to totally change their styles to suit, in-shape, 20-30 year olds, just like how Nordstrom has done in the past 5-8 years.
The cut of the clothes is fat at Gap and BR. Perhaps too many old and fat workers purchase inventory for Gap and BR.",2019-03-18T22:02:47Z,0

Especially as cheaper retailers are now making quite stylish clothes whereas before discount stores were seen as where you got daggy clothes that didn't last more than one wash cycle. Even what were considered fashionable brands like Mambo and Malibu are selling products in discount stores.  The Gap was based on being cool and they could charge a premium for it.  But fashion labels are not as important anymore so people aren't prepared to pay for cool when it comes to clothes.

Cheyenne Harmon,"Gap does have quality clothes. They should pick an age demographic and update their styles, this isn‚Äôt 1998-2005 anymore. Consumers don‚Äôt like big letters, and ‚Äúblend in‚Äù clothes. Fashion Nova, Forever 21, Zara and H&M are fast fashion stores, they create a sense of urgency. 1) the style may not sell out in 24-36 hours and 2) the style may be pulled within 2 weeks if its not ‚Äútrendy‚Äù anymore. The Gap clothes are lack luster and predictable. 

Also, traditional mall stores, Gap, Victoria Secret, JC Penny, Sears, and etc, are all struggling. Consumers are not going to the mall like they used to. With less foot traffic, statistically, it lessens the chance of impulse buying. 

I think Gap should partner with virtual reality, sponsor an IG model, and put fashion games on the App Store if they want to reach a younger 15-30 crowd. Being a stand alone fashion store isn‚Äôt enough in 2019.",2019-03-17T15:47:28Z,17

I remember it well, my pair upon first washing caused a hole in the thigh. It's been downhill ever since. It started with women's clothing then moved to the men's. Up to that point, my jeans lasted 10 years. I am nearly 73, male, etc so have a perspective of the decline. I know because a dear elderly friend told me in the late sixties she started turning new bought clothes inside out, then ran her sewing machine through each and every length of stitching. That caught my attention. She was alive and well during the Depression, and believed in making her clothes last. Seems everything now is lightweight and fragile.",2019-05-11T15:49:23Z,5

So, with that GAP needs to make trendier clothes with more affordable prices with reasonable quality. Most people aren't looking to keep clothes for many years to come which goes back to the fact that most shoppers are younger that need quick disposable outfits for going out and partying.

Jermaine Cornelius,"DRAB is the reason why I stopped shopping at GAP; the clothes there became very drab. Back in the mid to late 90's the GAP's clothes were stylish, colorful and very well made. I still have couple of sweaters and jackets that still look great today after all those years simply because they were very well made. But at some point during the mid 2000's their clothes became more and more drab and boring and meanwhile the prices stayed the same. I didn't mind the prices at all when the clothes were attractive. But I wasn't about to spend that kind of money on clothes that in my opinion looked lackluster + boring = DRAB. 

Since then it seems that more and more retailers are selling fast fashion which is pretty much the fast food of fashion because it is very cheaply made. A few years ago a H&M finally opened locally. I'd never been to one but I knew people who had shopped at one before and a lot of them raved about it. So I went there a few weeks after it's grand opening and it was a hot mess all up in there! It's common to see clothes tossed on floors in dressing rooms but clothes were strewn all over the entire store! It was as if a clothing bomb exploded in the place. Noticeably none of the employees seemed to care at all and neither did any of the crowd of customers. Of what was left hanging on racks I first noticed that the prices were extremely low. Secondly, the fact that the materials of the clothes looked and felt so poorly made explained why the prices were so cheap. I could tell right away that those clothes were only good for one or two wears, after that it wouldn't be any good. The quality was worse than Old Navy clothes because I think even Old Navy's clothes is more wearable after 1 or 2 wears. I thought to myself if that's what they want to buy so be it but I walked out of there and never went back.",2019-03-15T23:12:24Z,0

Gerry N,I really like gap clothing style in general it's just the quality is not there anymore. As many have stated below a few washes and the clothes starts fading and looking old. Then the small holes start and you have to retire the clothing to yard work duty. I also had many gap work pant zippers break on me giving me no option but to untuke my shirt or walk around flashing everyone. Gap zippers are just too small.I  have never had a zipper break with any other brand of pants.,2019-03-15T16:23:50Z,0

Hugues Jouffrai,"I don't think it's overpriced. Over the years i've found their clothes to last a lot longer than similarly priced brands. Their products are strong and comfortable so if you find some that fit your taste it's a great deal.
Shoppers will probably get over the trend of fast fashion as younger generations are more and more preocuppied with the environmental impact of their consumption. This might benefit companies that make durable yet accessible products like Gap. (I promise I never worked their, I'm just a satisfied customer)",2019-06-11T13:44:42Z,3

Samuel Spencer,"1:50 - 2:30, a lot of valuable information within this time stream period;

First point; the origin and purpose of the brand 'Gap' - the generational gap of baby boomers and post war veterans.

Second point; the purpose of the first Gap store to cater to both the baby boomers and post war veterans.

Third point; the products on offer by the Gap store was records (target audience are baby boomers, more likely to be aimed at post war veterans), tapes (target audience are baby boomers, however more likely aimed at post war veterans) and jeans (target audience are post war veterans however more aimed at baby boomers), compared to the fact that they no longer sell records or tapes - practically transitioning to selling just apparels and related accessorize such as belts, this could be as it was proving to be most dominant in generating revenues for reasons which are to be explained in the fourth point. This reveals that a company's products/service can identify who there target audience is

Fourth point, jeans including 'Levi jeans' were becoming successful due to the fact that jeans were revolutionising the social acceptability of 'casual attires', therefore what contributed to Levi jeans becoming a hit in the pre year 2000 was its convenient presence of the revolunisation of what was socially/professionally and publicly acceptable for wearing.

But clothing brands aren't important anymore- not unless you're the kind of person who wears Gucce ect ANd those brands are classic rather than cool. . It's about looks.

Fernando Avila,I think Gap can be saved because of its brand recognition. Banana Republic itself has struggled with its own image since it first started as a surplus safari brand then did a complete 180 and shifted to upscale business attire. Gap is reluctant to shift from preppy clothing to today's trends. Banana Republic has potential but its not being tapped into. I think both brands need to be reworked. TODAY'S consumers don't really care for old trends such as preppy- just look at all the big preppy brands- they're struggling.,2019-03-14T20:08:19Z,31

Pierre Stephens,"3:30 - Reason why GAP stores are struggling is because they don't appeal to discount/budget shoppers or upscale shoppers. but rather the folks in between, which is a cardinal sin in the world of business in this day and age. Old Navy is doing fairly good because they sell clothes at an affordable price point for budget-conscious Americans. GAP is too expensive for middle American and they should close all their GAP stores and just focus on their most thriving and affordable subsidiary- Old Navy. Old Navy is their cash cow- a place where you can buy a fairly stylish wardrobe at a great pricepoint.",2019-03-14T19:18:50Z,136
Jamil Gotcher,Just hearing you talk like they may have to close Gap is literally going to make me go buy up all that I can. I love the quality of those long sleeve t-shirts.

comment,"@MsJubjubbird Hm, very interesting thought - I think the newest generation that is just turning adult really is less fashion conscious, or at least their ideas about it are simpler. In some ways they are more like their grandparents - like to celebrate in nice clothes, but other than that want to be comfortable and don't really care what they wear, because everyone is staring at their phones, not each other. They also don't care much for fancy cars or big houses or status symbols.",2019-10-13T02:38:30Z,6

Koolkid,"I work at Gap in the UK. Quality is meh and they price a dress for ¬£69 when it actually costs ¬£10 to produce. Also without ""discounts"", we would shut down the next day. We can't sell anything at full price because customers are at least smart enough not to pay at that price. Gap of course still makes it seem like it is a steal when it is not. The styles are also mundane/boring which appeal to their core customer: old people

Also, another reason that they are failing is that they don't care about the Teen market.",2019-03-22T04:42:38Z,6
SakuraLaedy,That's interesting. Funnily enough my issue with gap was that it looks too much like old Navy in design with a higher cost. I like the quality of gap and some of their clothing unique to it. But now it looks too much like old Navy,2019-03-20T17:48:06Z,3
MsJubjubbird,Discount stores used to have rubbish clothes that you wouldn't be seen dead in. Now their clothes are quite good. And celebrities are launching their brands into them. Plus these days fashion is more in your phone and your tablet than what you wear- which means less money for clothes unless you are a high end shopper who doesn't notice.,2019-03-18T08:22:05Z,4
Christopher Dang,"Yup. People are saying the middle class is dying, but so is the middle class economy as a result. Mid-tier brands are struggling whereas low-end and super high end brands are doing well. We've shifted towards a mentality of either ""dirt cheap/high value"" or ""luxury"", and forsaking what's in between. Part of that in the clothing industry is due to more lax dress codes, the rise of athleisure/comfort clothing and the ""show off"" generation which is boosting the luxury tiers.",2019-03-16T13:12:32Z,24

xevious2501,"I grew up on the Gap brand in the 80's early 90's when they were the It' brand.  Quality was a mainstay and directly reflected their cost.   But, like Apple they pushed for the upper-class - upper-crust niche and began charging far beyond the quality of their product.  Then they expanded themselves creating and or acquiring similar brands further raising the cost of basic clothing.  And to make matters worst they also took the 'image' approach to their product sizes and size demographics.  removing larger sizes from their product lines.   In a nutshell they began shunning the very people who made their brand a success, and priced themselves away from profit margins.   Old Navy was created to address the issue and it worked, but the gap and all its other brands remained the same. so in reality they didnt fix the problem at all.   Then the quality their product also took a nose dive,  as they expanded their places of manufacturing  to more and more low cost low wage high labor haven,  poor countries around the world, which was fine for old navy product being far cheaper, but terribly worst for their other brands.  why pay 4x as much for an item thats only slightly better in quality than Old navy,  and its created by the same locations.   The nail in the coffin was loosing sight of the buyer.  So many retailers have shifted their profit cost margins to items that shouldn't cost much at all.  T-shirts costing 6 times their normal worth. simply because teens and young adults now where more t-shirts.   the product didnt justify the cost.    And so.. more and more was poorly produced high cost products became their mainstay, driven by greed and not by the Gaps past philosophy of providing the highest quality product for a fare price.    Gap products stood above the rest in the 80's and 90's.   Today theirs little to distinguish their products from Target or even walmarts,  but their prices remain thru the roof.",2019-03-14T18:45:20Z,2

Derek Bao,why go to any cloth store when you can get a t-shirt at walmart or five bellow for 5 dollars and look as good as anyone and their stupid brand name shirt which doesn't even matter most of the ones I mean are hanes and have the same quality without the logo,2019-03-14T22:11:27Z,8

moonlightstripes,@nordette depends on the store you go to. Aritzia is pretty expensive but it is pretty good quality in comparison to H&M. Most of the time you pay for what you get a price can go as long as the cost to make and the face of the brand.,2019-03-17T14:34:04Z,0

Markey Boi,"@zzz Not that I don't believe you, but I'm generally curious as to how much of a difference there is between prices. Could you give an example of a price for a clothing item in Mexico? (And Europe is more expense, but they also have 20 - 30% VAT and tariffs on stuff, whereas US and Mexico shouldn't have tariffs because of NAFTA.)",2019-03-15T02:45:13Z,0
zzz,PlanetVaster Well I‚Äôm from Mexico and I‚Äôve traveled to Europe and I can tell you clothing is more expensive in both Mexico and the countries I visited in Europe.,2019-03-15T01:33:35Z,12
Markey Boi,"@zzz Depends. With sales yes, but when not on sale and a pair of jeans costs $50 that's not affordable, especially not for most people. ""how much we make"" maybe what you make, but a lot of the US can't afford that. And that still didn't answer my question: What countries are clothes more expensive then the US. Back what you say up with evidence, not opinion.",2019-03-15T01:17:12Z,5
